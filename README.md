### Learning format

Investigate the files starting from 1.js and try to learn what is going on by reading the code, reading the comments and running it.

The root dir contains numbered files.

You can run each of these files using `node <number>` where `<number>` could be any number e.g. `1`, `2` etc. Press Ctrl + C to close it before opening the next one.

Each file uses different other files in this repository, progressively improving upon the previous and adding more functionality.
